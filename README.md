# Nordic_power_control_and_path_loss_monitoring
During my internship at Nordic Semiconductor, I developed two samples that establish a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection between a central and a peripheral device.

The first sample, a power control demo, monitors the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and adjusts the transmit (Tx) power of the peripheral accordingly.

The second sample monitors path lossâ€”defined as the difference between the transmitted signal strength and the RSSI (i.e., path loss = Tx - RSSI). Based on the path loss value, the system indicates the current state using LEDs:

    Low path loss: LED0 lights up

    Medium path loss: LED1 lights up

    High path loss: LED2 lights up

Both samples were tested using two nRF54L15 Development Kits (DKs).
